# Group Members: Christina Lyu, Aoi 

# Title: 

Content
Your initial and revised proposals should contain the following content:
1. Group Members: List the members of your group
2. Title: Your title
3. Purpose: Describe the general topic/phenomenon you want to study, as well some focused questions
that you hope to answer and specific hypotheses that you intend to assess.
4. Data: Describe the data that you plan to use, with specifications of where it can be found (URL) and a
short description. Eventually, you will probably want to combine data from multiple sources into one
file. We will discuss data management techniques in the coming weeks, but for now you should simply
list multiple sources if you have them.
5. Population: Specify what the observational units are (i.e. the rows of the data frame), describe the
larger population/phenomenon to which you’ll try to generalize, and (if appropriate) estimate roughly
how many such individuals there are in the population.
6. Response Variable: What the response variable? What are its units? Estimate the range of possible
values that it may take on.
7. Explanatory Variables: Describe the variables that you’ll examine for each observational unit (i.e. the
columns of the data frame). Carefully define each variable and describe how each was measured.
For categorical variables, list the possible categories; for quantitative variables, specify the units of
measurement. You may want to add more variables later on, but you should have at least 5 variables
already.
